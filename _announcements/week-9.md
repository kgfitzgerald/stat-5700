+ Start class with quiz over 4.2 - 4.4

### Homework problem 4.30 part c

Haven't covered Theorem required for #30 part c on homework - will do it together. 

**Tchebysheff's Theorem**: Let $Y$ be a random variable with finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Then, for any $k > 0$, 

$$P(|Y - \mu| < k\sigma) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}$$ or, equivalently

$$P(|Y - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$$

This can be used to find intervals (around the mean) in which you expect a random variable to occur with specified probability. Or alternatively the probability that a random variable falls within a specified distance from its mean. This works for ANY distribution, but gives fairly conservative bounds. 

**HW problem** - given random variable $X$ that has mean 220/3 and variance 20000/9. Asks to find an interval in which X should fall at least 75% of the time.

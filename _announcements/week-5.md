## Tuesday announcements

+ Realized there are two 7th edition pdfs floating around, and they're different! Posted the preferred version on Blackboard home page - it matches the hard copy of the text. Please confirm that this matches the version you are currently using, and if not, use the one moving forward. 

    + Correct version: has "plane search / region i" question for 2.132
    + Incorrect version: has proof for question 2.132

+ HW 04 due on Thursday, but solutions posted, graded on completion (relevant practice for the exam)
+ Lab 04 due date extended to next Thursday
+ No annotations due this week

## About the exam

+ In-class exam on Thursday
    + Seven questions, 15 parts total
    + 88 points
    + Calculator + one 8.5x11 (double-sided) "cheat sheet" allowed.
        + Exam 1 Review packet is a good place to start
        + Include practice problems! 
    + Annotated test corrections to earn 1/4 of points back after graded
+ Take-home exam handed out Thursday
    + 12 points
    + Will ask you to write a few T/F questions and choose 3 (out of 6) "meta-cognitive" reflection questions to respond to
    + AI is NOT allowed on this assignment (because I'm asking for YOUR personal reflections), nor is collaboration with other people
    + Due next Tuesday, but can request extension to Thursday if needed (intended to take much less time that typical homework assignment)
    
## Response to weekly check-in feedback

+ Homework length has been more manageable
+ Overwhelming desire to keep due dates on Thursdays (people can turn in early if they want)
+ "Sometimes it feels difficult to spread out the work, because sometimes we don't learn everything until 8hrs before"
    + Homework is always intended to be based on the PREVIOUS week's material, so you should have 1 full week to complete the assignment. 
    + In rare situations, a concept (that should represent a small proportion of the overall assignment) may be wrapped up on Tuesday, prior to a Thursday deadline. 
    + In no situation do I intend for an assignment to be due on the same day relevant material is covered in class - please come talk to be about specific examples if you feel like this is the case. 
    + Often, this class will be "iterative" in that we will return to the same ideas multiple times, adding to our toolbelt each time. So you may see a problem in one section that is intended to be completed "from scratch", and then we later learn a new method that makes that problem easier. Problem 3.10 (the "pair of rentals" question) is a good example of this; it is included in section 3.2 of the book (and can be solved using concepts learned through 3.2), even though the geometric distribution is not formally introduced until 3.5.
    + I expect some homework problems to feel unfamiliar / to be of greater difficulty that the examples seen in class. The "productive struggle" in intentional. But don't bang your head against a wall for too long! Come to student hours and/or post questions on Piazza for help getting started or to talk through problems/concepts. 
    
+ PS - I know the world has been a lot lately - always happy to chat/listen anytime :)

## A few problem solving tips

+ Remember you can re-write a probability as the sum of intersections: $P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B')$

+ Remember there are always two ways to re-write an intersection in terms of conditional probabilities 
    + P(A|B) and P(B|A) both have $P(A \cap B)$ on the numerator - can use that to reverse the conditional probability

+ Draw pictures to help you (re-)write probabilities as symbols


## What to put on your attendance notecard

-   Name
-   Date
-   (OPTIONAL) What was the "muddiest point" from today's class? I.e., what was confusing or unclear during today's class? What are you still grappling with?
-   (OPTIONAL) Is there anything going on in your life that you'd like me to know about? E.g., anxiety, upcoming interview, illness in the family, etc. {: .fs-5 }

## About the exam

+ In-class exam on Thursday
    + Seven questions, 15 parts total
    + 88 points
    + Calculator + one 8.5x11 (double-sided) "cheat sheet" allowed.
        + Exam 1 Review packet is a good place to start
        + Include practice problems! 
    + Annotated test corrections to earn 1/4 of points back after graded
+ Take-home exam handed out Thursday
    + 12 points
    + Will ask you to write a few T/F questions and choose 3 (out of 6) "meta-cognitive" reflection questions to respond to
    + AI is NOT allowed on this assignment (because I'm asking for YOUR personal reflections), nor is collaboration with other people
    + Due next Tuesday, but can request extension to Thursday if needed (intended to take much less time that typical homework assignment)
    

## A few problem solving tips

+ Remember you can re-write a probability as the sum of intersections: $P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B')$

+ Remember there are always two ways to re-write an intersection in terms of conditional probabilities 
    + P(A|B) and P(B|A) both have $P(A \cap B)$ on the numerator - can use that to reverse the conditional probability

+ Draw pictures to help you (re-)write probabilities as symbols

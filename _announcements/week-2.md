    + Settings issue on my part, so you weren't able to see others' comments right away. This should be fixed now.

## What to put on your attendance notecard

-   Date
-   (OPTIONAL) What was the "muddiest point" from today's class? I.e., what was confusing or unclear during today's class? What are you still grappling with?

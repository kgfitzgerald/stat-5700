For ease, the pair (1,2) is simply written as 12; (5,6) is written as 56, etc.

+ $A = \{12,22,32,42,52,62,14,24,34,44,54,65,16,26,36,46,56,66\}$

+ $C' = \{22,24,26,42,44,46\}$

+ $A \cap B = \{22,24,26,42,44,46,62,64,66\}$

+ $A \cap B' = \{12,14,16,32,34,36,52,54,56\}$

+ $A' \cup B = \{11,21,31,41,51,61,13,23,33,43,53,63,15,25,35,45,55,65,22,42,62,24,44,64,26,46,66\}$

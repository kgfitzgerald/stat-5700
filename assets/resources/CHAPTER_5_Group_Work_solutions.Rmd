# Problem 1

Suppose that you randomly select a student from a large population of 4th grade students and record the student's sex and number of siblings. Let M = 1 if the selected student is male and M = 0 if the selected student is female. Let S record the student's number of siblings. The proportion of the population of students falling into each category of M and S is recorded in the table below.

| \# of siblings: | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Female          | .10 | .18 | .12 | .07 | .04 |
| Male            | .12 | .18 | .14 | .03 | .02 |

a. What is the support of $M$? Of $S$?
b. Find the probability that the randomly selected student will be male with two siblings
c. Find $P(M = 0, S \leq 2)$
d. Find the probability that the randomly selected student will be an only child
e. Find the marginal distribution of $M$
f. Find the marginal distribution of $S$
g. Are $M$ and $S$ independent?

## Solution

### Part a

$$\mathbb{S}_M = \{0,1\}$$
$$\mathbb{S}_S = \{0,1,2,3,4\}$$

### Part b

$P(M = 1, S = 2) = 0.14$

### Part c

$P(M = 0, S \leq 2) = 0.12 + 0.18 + 0.14 = 0.44$

### Part d

$P(S = 0) = 0.10 + 0.12 = 0.22$

### Part e

|  | P(M  = m) |
|-----------------|------|
| Female (M = 0)         | 0.51 |
| Male    (M = 1)        | 0.49 |

### Part f

| \# of siblings (S): | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| P(S = s)          | .22 | .36 | .26 | .10 | .06 |

### Part g

Independent if and only if $P(S=s)P(M=m) = P(S=s,M=m)$ for all $s,m$. For the coordinate (0,1), we have $P(S = 0)P(M = 0) = 0.22*0.51 = 0.1122 \neq P(S = 0, M = 0) = .10$, therefore $S$ and $M$ are NOT independent. 



$$\sigma^2_y = \frac{11}{144}$$

# Problem 2

Show that $Cov(X,Y) = E(XY) - \mu_X\mu_Y$. 

> *Hint: start with the definition $Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - \mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$*

## Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y) &= E((X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)) \\
&= E(XY - X\mu_Y - Y\mu_X + \mu_X\mu_Y)\\
&= E(XY) - \mu_YE(X) - \mu_XE(Y) + \mu_X\mu_Y \\
&= E(XY) - \mu_Y\mu_X - \mu_X\mu_Y+ \mu_X\mu_Y \\
&= E(XY) - \mu_X\mu_Y
\end{aligned}
$$

# Problem 3

Show that $E(XY) = \mu_X\mu_Y + \rho_{XY}\sigma_X\sigma_Y$ 

## Solution

By re-arranging the identity proven in Problem 1, we have

$$E(XY) = Cov(X,Y) + E(X)E(Y)$$

Since the correlation is defined as $\rho_{XY} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_y}$, we have $Cov(X,Y) = \rho_{XY}\sigma_X\sigma_y$. Plugging in gives

$$E(XY) = \rho_{XY}\sigma_X\sigma_y + E(X)E(Y)$$

# Problem 4

Show that if two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then their covariance is 0. 

> *Hint: start with the shortcut formula $Cov(X,Y) = E(XY) - \mu_X\mu_Y$ and re-write $E(XY)$ as a double sum.*

## Solution

Let $X,Y$ be independent. We will therefore use the fact that $f(x,y) = f_x(x)f_y(y)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y) &= E((X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)) \\
&=\sum_x\sum_yxyf(x,y) - \mu_X\mu_Y \\
&=\sum_x\sum_yxyf_x(x)f_y(y) - \mu_X\mu_Y \\
&=\sum_xxf_x(x)\sum_yyf_y(y)- \mu_X\mu_Y \\
&=E(X)E(Y)- \mu_X\mu_Y\\
&=0
\end{aligned}
$$

a. Find $Cov(M,S)$
a. Suppose that instead of just one student, you sample 12 students. Let $S_1, \dots S_{12}$ represent the number of siblings reported by each student (you can assume that these random variables are independent). Let $\overline{S} = \sum_{i = 1}^{12} \frac{S_i}{12}$ be the average number of siblings in the sample. Find $E(\overline{S})$ and $V(\overline{S})$

<!-- 1. (Challenge) Consider the random variables $A, B, \text{ and} D$, where $B$ is defined in terms of the other two random variables as $B = A + D$. Suppose that $V(A) = V(B)$. What does this imply about $Cov(A,D)$ and $V(D)$? -->
<!-- 1. (Challenge) For independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, find an expression for $V(XY)$ -->

## Solutions

### Part a

Using the marginal distribution found in Group Work 4.1, we have 

$$E(M) = 0(.51) + 1(.49) = 0.49$$
$$E(M^2) = 0^2(.51) + 1^2(.49) = 0.49$$
$$V(M) = 0.49 - (0.49)^2 = 0.2499$$

### Part b

Using the marginal distribution found in Group Work 4.1, we have

$$E(S) = 0(.22) + 1(.36) + 2(.26) + 3(.10) + 4(.06) = 1.42$$

$$E(S^2) = 0^2(.22) + 1^2(.36) + 2^2(.26) + 3^2(.10) + 4^2(.06) = 3.26$$

$$V(S) = 3.26 - (1.42)^2 = 1.2436$$

### Part c

$$\begin{aligned}
Cov(M,S) &= \sum_m\sum_s msf(m,s) \\
&= (1)(1)(.18) + (1)(2)(.14) + (1)(3)(.03) + (1)(4)(.02) \\
&= 0.63
\end{aligned}$$

*Note that the other 6 (m,s) coordinate pairs have at least one 0, so the term cancels out of double sum*

### Part d

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(\overline{S}) &= E(\sum_{i = 1}^{12}\frac{S_i}{12}) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{12}E(\frac{S_i}{12}) \ \ \ \  \text{b/c E() is a linear operator} \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{12} \frac{1}{12}E(S_i) \\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{12} \frac{1}{12}(1.42) \\
&= \frac{1}{12}(1.42)\sum_{i = 1}^{12} 1 \\
&= \frac{1}{12}(1.42)(12)\\
&=1.42 = E(S_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

# Problem 5

*[HTZ 4.4-2 - homework problem!]* Let $X$ and $Y$ have the joint pdf $f(x,y) = x + y, 0 \leq x \leq 1, 0 \leq y \leq 1$

a. Find the marginal pdfs $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ and show that $X$ and $Y$ are dependent.
b. Compute:
    i. $\mu_X$
    ii. $\mu_Y$
    iii. $\sigma^2_X$
    iv. $\sigma^2_Y$
    
## Solution

### Part a

$$f_x(x) = \int_0^1(x + y)dy = x + \frac{1}{2}, \ \ 0 \leq x \leq 1$$

$$f_y(y) = \int_0^1(x + y)dx = y + \frac{1}{2}, \ \ 0 \leq y \leq 1$$

$$f_x(x)f_y(y) = (x + \frac{1}{2})(y + \frac{1}{2}) \neq x + y$$

### Part b

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_x &= \int_0^1 x(x + \frac{1}{2})dx \\
&= \left[\frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{4}x^2\right]  |_0^1 \\
&= \frac{7}{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\mu_y = \int_0^1 y(y + \frac{1}{2})dy = \frac{7}{12}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &= \int_0^1 x^2(x + \frac{1}{2})dx \\
&= \left[\frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{1}{6}x^3\right]  |_0^1 \\
&= \frac{5}{12} \\
\sigma_x^2 &= E(X^2) - \mu_x^2 \\
&= \frac{5}{12} - \left(\frac{7}{12}\right)^2 \\
&= \frac{11}{144}
\end{aligned}
$$

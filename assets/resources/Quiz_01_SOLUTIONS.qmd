## **Problem 1**

How many ways are there to choose 8 applicants from a pool of 73 applicants? Write out the formula, but you do not need to calculate the result.

$$
\textcolor{red}{\binom{73}{8} = \frac{73!}{65!\,8!}}
$$


## **Problem 2**

Suppose $P(A) = 0.45$, $P(B) = 0.30$, and $P(A \cup B) = 0.6$.

### a. Find $P(A \cap B)$

$$
\textcolor{red}{P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) = 0.45 + 0.30 - 0.60 = 0.15}
$$

### b. Find $P(A' \cap B')$

$$
\textcolor{red}{P(A' \cap B') = P[(A \cup B)']=1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40}
$$



## **Problem 3**

Suppose you draw one card at random from a standard 52-card deck.

Events:
- $A$: The card is red  
- $B$: The card is black  
- $C$: The card is a heart  

For each pair of events, indicate whether they are mutually exclusive, mutually exhaustive, both, or neither.

### a. $A$ and $B$

\textcolor{red}{Mutually exclusive and mutually exhaustive}

### b. $A$ and $C$

\textcolor{red}{Neither}

### c. $B$ and $C$

\textcolor{red}{Mutually exclusive}

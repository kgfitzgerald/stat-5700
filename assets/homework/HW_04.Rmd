## Instructions

- Homework problems come from the 7th edition of the text *Mathematical Statistics with Applications* by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer, as well as (potential) additional problems provided by the instructor.
- You are responsible for understanding the concepts covered in all problems listed in a homework assignment, but only even-numbered problems should be turned in. 
- Be NEAT and show work to support your answers. Points will be deducted if your answer is not adequately supported or the work cannot be readily followed. 
- You are encouraged to work together on homework assignments, but each person must write up and turn in their own work and solutions. 
- You will turn in this assignment by scanning your work and uploading a single pdf to Blackboard.

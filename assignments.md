## Labs (due Saturdays, 11:59pm)

The links below take you to a template Quarto (.qmd) file for each lab. You should download the .qmd and place it in the STAT_5700 folder you created on your computer. Complete the lab by typing your code & answers in the .qmd. You will turn in a rendered html file (converted to a .zip) to Blackboard. 


{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_01.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_02.qmd" %}

<!-- {% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_03.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_04.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_05.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_06.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_08.qmd" %}

## Reading annotations (due Saturdays, 11:59pm)

Most weeks you will be assigned an article, book chapter, and/or video about applications of probability & statistics and/or ethical issues in the field. Rather than a traditional discussion board, we will use Perusall, a community annotation tool, where you can engage with the text by highlighting, commenting, asking questions, and responding to your peers' comments/questions, all on a shared document. You can access these assignments by navigating on the Blackboard home page to Perusall - Reading Annotations.

Most weeks, you will have 4 things to submit by Thursdays at 11:59pm. See below for details and links to the assignments. 

## Homework

The links below provide the assigned problems for each homework. Your work must be hand-written, and you should submit a single pdf to the corresponding assignment on Blackboard.

[HW 01](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/stat-5700/assets/homework/HW_01.pdf)

[HW 02](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/stat-5700/assets/homework/HW_02.pdf)

[HW 03](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/stat-5700/assets/homework/HW_03.pdf)

[HW 04](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/stat-5700/assets/homework/HW_04.pdf)

[HW 05](https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/stat-5700/assets/homework/HW_05.pdf)

## Labs

The links below take you to a template Quarto (.qmd) file for each lab. You should download the .qmd and place it in the STAT_5700 folder you created on your computer. Complete the lab by typing your code & answers in the .qmd. You will turn in a rendered pdf file to Blackboard. 


{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_01.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_02.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_03.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_04.qmd" %}

{% include download.html path="assets/labs/Lab_05.qmd" %}


## Reading annotations

Most weeks you will be assigned an article, book chapter, and/or video about applications of probability & statistics and/or ethical issues in the field. Rather than a traditional discussion board, we will use Perusall, a community annotation tool, where you can engage with the text by highlighting, commenting, asking questions, and responding to your peers' comments/questions, all on a shared document. You can access these assignments [here](https://elearning.villanova.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_182880_1&content_id=_5566839_1), or by navigating on the Blackboard home page to Perusall - Reading Annotations. 

## Weekly check-ins

Finally, each week you should fill out the brief weekly check-in surveys, which are emailed out at the end of class each Thursday and due at 11:59pm. It consists of a few short questions for you to reflect and provide feedback about the course each week; it should not take more than 5 minutes to complete.
